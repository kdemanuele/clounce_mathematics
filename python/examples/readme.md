# Examples in Project

The following examples have been implemented in Python to demostrate the concepts described in [Clounce.com](https://www.clounce.com/) articles

| Concept | Library Method | Example |
|:---------|:----------------|:---------|
| [Arithmetic Mean](http://www.clounce.com/mathematics/arithmetic_mean) | ClouncMath::arithmeticMean | python3 arithmetic_mean.py |

**Note: For optimal implementations of the above concepts and support for real projects it is recommended to use the library [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) **
